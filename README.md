# SurferHome
A website designed for representation of [Surfer Browser](https://github.com/ItzzRitik/Surfer), which is a mobile web browser based on Google Chromium API hence, fast enough for all browsing needs. Chromium API is an open source library that is actually being used in Google’s own browser Google Chrome, so Surfer’s speed is quite predictable.  

This website is fabricated for cleanliness and simplicity. Have a look on it now [here](https://itzzritik.github.io/SurferHome)
